2016 Ecuador earthquake,4/16/2016,,Experts Say Japan and Ecuador Earthquakes Probably Unrelated,"A week ago , the Japanese island of Kyushu in the country ’s south was hit by an earthquake that killed at least nine people , injured hundreds of others and caused significant damage . 
Measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale , the quake mainly affected the town of Mashiki on the outskirts of Kumamoto city . 
The real devastation , however , came around 48 hours later , when the same region was struck by a far more powerful , magnitude 7.3 quake . 
At least 33 others were killed in the second quake , which left close to 200,000 displaced and thousands of homes without electricity or running water . 
The same day as the second temblor , around 9,000 miles away on the other side of the Pacific Ocean , Ecuador was hit with an earthquake that far exceeded the destruction seen in Japan . 
Even as the death toll from the 7.8 - magnitude quake rose to almost 600 , the South American nation was rocked by several aftershocks — including one on Wednesday that measured 6.1 . 
Despite the timing of the two disasters and their presence in the earthquake - prone zone known as the Ring of Fire , seismologists say a connection between them is unlikely and not necessarily indicative of a larger trend . ","A week|0 1|0|TIME|None

2015 Chile earthquake,9/16/2015,9/17/2015,Facebook’s ‘Safety Check’ Feature Used in Aftermath of 8.3-Magnitude Chile Earthquake,"In the aftermath of the 8.3 - magnitude earthquake that shook Chile Wednesday night , many Facebook users utilized “ Safety Check , ” a feature on the social media website used to give updates to friends during a disaster . Facebook users with friends in the quake - prone nation – including residents of the Chilean capital , Santiago – were prompted to access Safety Check when they logged on . 
The feature displayed a list of Facebook friends near the disaster , divided into three categories : all friends in area , friends marked safe and friends not marked yet . As each friend in the impacted area marked themselves “ safe , ” users connected to them were sent notifications . 
Friends could also mark others “ safe , ” in case that person was unable to access the social media website following the earthquake . The social media website describes the safety feature as a way to “ connect with friends and loved ones during a disaster ” and adds , “ If you 're near a natural disaster , you can tell friends if you 're safe and check to see if they 're safe , too. ” [ [ 253618711 , C ]] According to this post from Facebook co - founder Mark Zuckerberg , Safety Check first launched in October 2014 . 
Facebook previously used the Safety Check feature in late April 2015 to connect survivors of the deadly Nepal earthquake with their loved ones . “ Over the last few years there have been many disasters and crises where people have turned to the Internet for help . 
Each time , we see people use Facebook to check on their loved ones and see if they 're safe . 
Connecting with people is always valuable , but these are the moments when it matters most , ” Zuckerberg wrote . Zuckerberg said the feature was inspired by the devastating , 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011 . The U.S. Geological Survey reported the epicenter of Wednesday ’s earthquake was approximately 29 miles west of Illapel , a town of about 35,000 residents approximately 175 miles north of Santiago . 
The massive quake forced more than 1 million residents to evacuate . ","8.3 - magnitude|5 6 7|0|MAG|mag

Its residents , startled from the first quake , were jolted into a new level of anxiety by Friday ’s severe follow - up , and a persistent “ swarm ” of aftershocks is expected to torment them for days , if not weeks . 
AD “ We ’re pretty much scared to death , ” said Nancy Pace , 66 , who runs the Bake My Day pastry business and feared another large quake could hit at “ any second . "" 
AD “ The whole town is definitely on edge , ” she told The Washington Post on Saturday . 
"" We ’re all really struggling with that . 
We ’re grateful we do n’t have a massive disaster yet , but we ’re dealing with our own feelings of being scared . ” Pace and her roommate “ were getting slammed back and forth between the walls ” during the earthquake Friday night — one of the biggest in California history — and had been so afraid of her home collapsing from a subsequent quake that they slept outside on air mattresses along with their neighbors .

2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes,7/5/2019,7/15/2019,"Ridgecrest aftershock prognosis: They won’t stop for years, and another strong one is possible","A 4.9 - magnitude earthquake in the Ridgecrest area early Friday drove home what seismologists have been telling Southern Californians for the past week : In the wake of two strong quakes July 4 and 5 , that area is likely to keep shaking for years . 
And while the chance of another damaging aftershock is small , it will be elevated as long as that increased shaking continues . “ Each earthquake is like a roll of the dice , ” said Nicholas van der Elst , a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey who ’s an expert on aftershocks . 
“ Each has the same probability of being large . ” A 6.4 - magnitude earthquake July 4 and a 7.1 - magnitude quake July 5 centered in the desert near Ridgecrest – but felt across hundreds of miles – set off a huge jump in seismic activity on that system of faults . 
Through Friday morning , July 12 , almost 1,400 quakes of magnitude 2.5 or higher ( including 28 of magnitude 4.5 or stronger ) had struck the area . 
More than 10,000 small quakes were recorded as well – and seismologists say even more have occurred but are n’t in the data because they got lost in the noise of the biggest quakes . 
The number of 2.5 or stronger earthquakes has been dropping throughout the week — and that ’s actually happening at a faster rate than average , Caltech seismologist Lucy Jones has been saying . 
Since peaking at 488 on Saturday , July 6 , the number of 2.5 quakes dropped to 63 on Thursday , July 11 . ","4.9 - magnitude|1 2 3|0|MAG|mag

2011 Burma earthquake,3/24/2011,,Report: Dozens killed in Myanmar earthquake,"The death toll from a powerful earthquake that hit Myanmar has gone up to 75 , state media reported Friday . 
At least 111 people were injured , Myanmar Radio reported . 
The 6.8 - magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Thursday near its borders with China , Thailand and Laos , according to the U.S. Geological Survey . 
It was a relatively shallow quake , which can be very destructive . The Geological Survey said the quake was 6 miles ( 10 km ) deep , putting it fairly close to the surface . 
Myanmar , which is also known as Burma , has been badly hit by natural disasters in the past few years . A powerful cyclone in 2008 left an estimated 100,000 people dead and another one two years later left 70,000 people homeless , the United Nations said . 
The quake was significantly less powerful than the one that hit Japan two weeks ago , causing a tsunami and prompting fears of a nuclear meltdown . 
The series of disasters in Japan has left more than 10,000 people dead . The Myanmar quake was roughly comparable in magnitude and depth to last year 's Haiti earthquake , which measured 7.0 . ","Myanmar|9;6;0;15|0;2;4;6|LOC|loc

A total of 390 houses , 14 monasteries , and nine government department buildings were destroyed in worst - hit villages such as Tarlay and and Mong Lin in Shan state , the government said . But the Thai - based Shan Herald Agency for News ( SHAN ) said , based on its feedback , the casualty toll had climbed to 130 dead and 230 injured . "" More than 80 coffins were sold this morning in [ the main township of ] Tachileik , following Thursday 's 6.8 magnitude quake , which had tremors being felt as far away as the Thai and Vietnamese capitals of Bangkok and Hanoi and parts of China , "" the agency quoted sources as saying .

The magnitude - 6.8 quake struck near the Lao and Thai borders , and was felt as far away as the Thai capital Bangkok , and in the Vietnamese capital , Hanoi . The town of Tachileik and surrounding villages in Shan state appear to have borne the brunt of the earthquake . 
There are fears the casualties could be much higher . 
Burma is ill prepared to deal with natural disasters , says the BBC 's Rachel Harvey in Bangkok . 
Communication systems and infrastructure are poor and the military government , still in charge until the handover to a new civilian - led administration , tends to limit the flow of information .

The magnitude - 6.0 earthquake that struck at 3.20 am , about six miles from the city of Napa , ruptured water mains and gas lines , left two adults and a child critically injured , upended bottles and casks at some of Napa Valley ’s famed wineries and sent residents running out of their homes in the darkness . 
President Barack Obama was briefed on the earthquake , the White House said . 
Federal officials also have been in touch with state and local emergency responders and Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for southern Napa County , directing state agencies to respond with equipment and personnel . 
“ This was a pretty big jolt in Napa , but it certainly is not ‘ The Big One ’ , ” Barry Martin , Napa ’s community outreach co-ordinator , said in comments to local television , referring to fears Californians have of a catastrophic quake along one of the seismic faults underneath the state . 
California is forecast to experience a much more powerful earthquake at some point , but scientists do not know exactly when it will come or how strong it will be , said a US Geological Survey geophysicist , Don Blakeman . “ Usually when people talk about ‘ The Big One , ’ they ’re talking about something on the order of a magnitude 9 , which of course is tremendously more powerful ” than Sunday ’s quake , Blakeman said .

2014 South Napa earthquake,8/24/2014,,Napa Earthquake Cracks Open New Fears of ‘The Big One’,"The South Napa earthquake that struck northern California on Sunday has cracked open new fears among state residents that “ the big one ” is imminent . 
The 6.0 - magnitude earthquake was the largest to strike the region in 25 years , and offers a painful reminder that the San Andreas Fault is overdue for a powerful rupture . 
Experts caution that it ’s impossible to predict exactly when the big one will occur , but there ’s a good possibility that it could happen within the next three decades . 
Continue reading below Our Featured Videos “ The area surrounding the epicenter of the main shock is continuing to experience a number of aftershocks , ” the U.S. Geological Survey notes as part of an ongoing effort to monitor aftershocks in and around Napa Valley . 
“ As of Tuesday Aug. 26 , 4 PM PDT , there have been more than 80 aftershocks , ” the agency adds . 
But “ only four of these have had magnitudes greater than 3 . ” The U.S. Geological Survey warns that there is a 12 percent chance that a “ strong and possibly damaging aftershock ” that is M5 or greater could hit the same region within the next seven days .

More than 170 people were injured , and 100 homes are now uninhabitable , the state Office of Emergency Services said Sunday . 
In the first uncertain minutes , a seismologist at the U.S Geological Survey 's Bay Area headquarters pinned the blame on the Franklin Fault , which has been inactive for thousands of years . 
By morning , the sun lay bare what darkness hid : 
Buckled pavement and cracked curbs lined up along the West Napa Fault for up to 10 miles ( 16 kilometers ) .

2014 South Napa earthquake,8/24/2014,8/28/2014,Shaking Continues Near South Napa Earthquake Epicenter With 8 New Tremors In Last 24 Hours,"AMERICAN CANYON ( CBS SF ) – Seismic activity continues more than four days after a magnitude 6.0 earthquake rocked the southern end of Napa County on Sunday . 
Between Wednesday morning and day break Tuesday the USGS reports eight more aftershocks hit the region , which runs along the border with Solano County . 
The largest of the eight small quakes measured just 2.6 on the Richter Scale , much smaller than the largest aftershock : a 3.9 magnitude which hit Tuesday . 
All of the recent shaking registered at least a 1.5 magnitude , but none carried the strength to cause significant damage .

Those who could worked tirelessly through the night , searching for the living under piles of rubble , following the 7.1 - magnitude quake that devastated central and southern Mexico on Tuesday . 
Others rushed about the city , gathering supplies—water , medicine , generators , shovels , gloves—to bring to the hundreds of volunteers and security forces attempting to rescue those trapped under dozens of collapsed buildings in the capital . 
Still others reacted on social media—watching from afar , retweeting news about the latest updates , lists of buildings in need of supplies , the names of those being pulled out alive , and information on the whereabouts of the few lucky people in Mexico City who , though trapped under tons of debris , were rescued after managing to make contact with the outside world using their cellphones .

On Tuesday morning , just before the latest tragedy hit , the number one trend on Mexican social media was “ earthquake drill ” as thousands took part in a city - wide exercise meant to mark the anniversary of the devastating ‘ 85 tremor .

Then , less than two weeks later and about 400 miles ( 650 kilometers ) away , a 7.1 - magnitude earthquake hit Mexico City and the surrounding area , killing more than 200 people . "" This is what you guys keep us around for , "" Emily Brodsky , a seismologist at the University of California , Santa Cruz , told Live Science . 
"" It 's our job to try to figure out if there 's a connection . "" 
[ The 10 Biggest Earthquakes in History ] The second earthquake , the epicenter of which was in the state of Puebla , also hit 32 years to the day after the devastating 1985 Mexico City earthquake . 
That quake caused the collapse of hundreds of buildings and killed an estimated 10,000 people . 
The 1985 earthquake resulted from a lurch of the Cocos tectonic plate that 's subducting , or sliding , under the North American Plate . 
But the two recent earthquakes happened within the subducting plate itself because of the tension that builds up as the plate bends , said Ross Stein , CEO of Temblor.net , a global risk app that aims to help people learn and reduce their seismic risk . ","8.1 - magnitude|3 4 5|0|MAG|mag

Pena Nieto ’s approval ratings have plumbed depths lower than any recent president , and his Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) faces a major struggle to retain power in presidential elections next July . 
The law bars him from seeking re-election .

2016 Kumamoto earthquakes,4/16/2016,,Japan earthquake: Powerful new tremor in Kumamoto,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Damage has again been severe , as Rupert Wingfield - Hayes reports A more powerful earthquake has rocked the southern Japanese city of Kumamoto in the middle of the night , a day after an earlier tremor killed nine people . 
The magnitude - 7.3 quake hit at a depth of 10 km ( six miles ) at 01:25 on Saturday ( 15:25 GMT on Friday ) in Kyushu region . 
At least three people died and hundreds were injured . 
A village has been evacuated after a dam collapsed , media reports say . A tsunami warning was issued , and lifted some 50 minutes later . 
Japan is regularly hit by earthquakes but stringent building codes mean that they rarely cause significant damage . 
This new earthquake in Kyushu was much bigger and hit a wider area than the one that struck Kumamoto on Thursday night , says the BBC 's Rupert Wingfield - Hayes in Tokyo . 
In one town near the coast , the city hall has been so badly damaged there are fears it could collapse . ","Kumamoto|32;18|0;5|LOC|loc

2016 Kumamoto earthquakes,4/16/2016,4/16/2016,"More powerful magnitude-7.3 quake rocks Kumamoto, kills dozens","As Kyushu residents attempted to get through a sleepless night , another strong earthquake rocked Kumamoto early Saturday , killing 32 people and injuring more than 900 , bringing the combined death toll from Thursday ’s quake to at least 41 . The magnitude - 7.3 quake hit at 1:25 a.m. and registered upper 6 on Japan ’s seismic intensity scale of 7 in Kumamoto Prefecture . 
It was more powerful than the temblor that barely a day earlier killed nine people and left more than 1,000 injured in the Kyushu area , according to the Meteorological Agency . 
As reports came in of people trapped in collapsed buildings , fires and power outages , authorities warned of widespread damage . 
Heavy rain forecast for the coming days could lead to more landslides and weaken already damaged structures , the agency said . 
The powerful shaking triggered a landslide that swept away homes and cut off a national highway in Minamiaso . 
Unlike Thursday ’s quake , which mostly damaged old houses in the town of Mashiki , newer buildings also took damage and some collapsed . 
The quake , which saw its preliminary magnitude upgraded from 7.1 , originated at a depth of about 12 km and is now believed to have been “ the main quake , ” rather than the ones that hit Thursday night , which are now considered foreshocks , the agency said in a news conference early Saturday .

2017 Puebla earthquake,9/19/2017,,The Strange Tectonic Coincidence of Mexico’s September Earthquakes,"In 1325 , the Aztecs , until then a nomadic people , chose the site of their capital , Tenochtitlan , based on a prophecy that the location would be marked by an eagle eating a snake while perched on a cactus . 
That the cactus in question happened to sit on an island in a mucky lake did not , apparently , deter them from seeing it as a divine revelation ; they went ahead and built a great city with grand temples and market squares on a tiny patch of land in a swamp . 
That metropolis is now Mexico City . 
The cruel coincidence of there being a large earthquake in Mexico City on September 19th , the exact anniversary of the devastating magnitude - 8.1 quake that killed at least five thousand people in the city in 1985 , seems similarly preordained . 
But a closer look at the details partly dispels its statistical improbability . 
Neither quake was actually centered on Mexico City . 
The epicenter of the 1985 event was two hundred and twenty miles to the west , off the coast of Michoacán , while the recent quake was generated about seventy miles to the southeast , in the state of Puebla . ","1325|1|0|TIME|None

It was among thousands of aftershocks recorded in the wake of that earlier quake , which was the most powerful to hit Mexico in 32 years and killed at least 96 people . 
? Bettina Cruz , a resident of Juchitan , Oaxaca , said by phone with her voice still shaking that the new quake felt "" horrible . "" "" Homes that were still standing just fell down , "" Cruz said . 
"" It 's hard . 
We are all in the streets . ""

Earthquakes rattle the globe every day , big and small : 
Just today , the U.S. Geological Survey has detected at least 19 earthquakes across the world — most notably a magnitude 7.1 earthquake that rocked central Mexico , with fatalities estimated in the hundreds . 
Earthquakes all spring from faults deep underground , but what kind ? 
The impact and severity of each quake depends on the answer to that question . 
The Earth 's crust is made of a jigsaw puzzle of continental and oceanic plates that are constantly ramming each other , sliding past each other , or pulling apart . 
Along the Ring of Fire girding the Pacific Ocean , for example , the seafloor plunges beneath Asia and the Americas , building mountains , feeding volcanoes , and triggering earthquakes . ","Earth|10;1|0;5|LOC|None

Share Tweet By Ellalyn De Vera - Ruiz The 6.1 - magnitude earthquake that jolted parts of Luzon , including Metro Manila on Monday had spawned close to 500 lesser - sized tremors in a span of 15 hours . 
According to Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology ( Phivolcs ) science research assistant Maila Advincula , as of 8 a.m. Tuesday , 491 aftershocks have been recorded close to the original source of the 6.1 - magnitude earthquake . 
Of the recorded aftershocks , 62 were plotted and only eight were felt , ranging between magnitudes 1.4 and 3.4 and intensities 1 and 3 . Advincula explained that the earthquakes occurred at shallow depths and can be possibly attributed to the movement of an unnamed local fault in the vicinity of Zambales province . 
She warned the public that aftershocks , mostly with smaller magnitudes , may persist for the next one to two weeks . The 6.1 - magnitude tremor on Monday caused panic in Luzon , especially in the metropolis as Phivolcs has repeatedly warned that Metro Manila is due for a “ big one , ” a term used to describe a destructive earthquake , which could measure 7.2 - magnitude and can occur along the West Valley Fault System located in eastern Metro Manila . 
Advincula clarified that Monday ’s quake was not generated by the West Valley Fault nor the Manila Trench—an ocean trench west of the country that could cause tsunami after a powerful earthquake . 
On average , around 20 earthquakes daily are recorded by Phivolcs all over the country , but some of them are too weak to be felt . ","491 aftershocks|0 1;23 24|0;2|NUM|None

2019 Luzon earthquake,4/22/2019,4/25/2019,Phivolcs: No volcanic unrest in Pinatubo after Luzon quake,"MANILA , Philippines — Mt. Pinatubo is not exhibiting unusual activities following the magnitude 6.1 earthquake that jolted Luzon , the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology assured the public Thursday . 
Phivolcs made the statement following concerns that the quake that killed at least 16 people and injured 86 has effects on the active volcano located on the boundaries of Pampanga , Tarlac and Zambales . 
The earthquake — which was tectonic in origin—hit Castillejos , Zambales late Monday afternoon . “ So far , the Pinatubo Volcano Seismic Monitoring network has not detected any changes in the condition of the volcano after the occurrence of the magnitude 6.1 earthquake that may indicate any sign of volcanic unrest , ” Phivolcs said . 
The volcanologists who were conducting fieldwork inside the crater when the earthquake took place found no steaming activity before , during and after the quake , the agency added . 
It explained that the reported emission of unusual smoke coming from the Pinatubo and other observations were actually dust clouds generated by rockslides . 
These were subsequently blown by the wind . “ These rockslides resulted from the strong ground shaking produced by the magnitude 6.1 earthquake and succeeding aftershocks . 
The generation of dust clouds was verified by Phivolcs Quick Response Team who went to Sitio Pasbul , Brgy . ","MANILA|0|0|LOC|None

2013 Bohol earthquake,10/15/2013,10/15/2013,What Caused the Deadly Philippines Earthquake?,"A deadly magnitude - 7.1 earthquake struck the central Philippines on a national holiday yesterday . 
The temblor was the strongest to shake the area in 23 years , Renato Solidum , director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology , told the Philippine Daily Inquirer . 
An estimated 43,000 people experienced severe shaking , according to the U.S. Geological Survey . 
The likely culprit is the East Bohol Fault , Solidum said . The East Bohol Fault , which crosses southern Bohol Island , helps relieve some of the tectonic pressure on the Philippines . 
The islands are crumpling between three crashing tectonic plates : the Philippine , Sunda and Eurasia plates . Though the East Bohol Fault is n't along one of the colliding plate boundaries , it is a reverse fault . 
When the fault breaks , the earth on either side of the fracture moves closer together , one block sliding up on top of the other . 
This compression takes up some of the constant squeezing . ","Philippines|9;32|0;3|LOC|loc

Phivolcs research analyst Nolan Evangelista said in a state news report that the ground rupture occurs only once in 100 years . 
The new fault is manifested on the surface with the upliftment of the southern part of the ground rupture up to almost three meters , while the northern part remains lower , Evangelista said . 
He explained that the layering of the rocks beneath the rupture break during an earthquake , creating a sound similar to an explosion .

A geologist at the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology , Maria Isabel Abigania , says a ground rupture pushed up a stretch of ground by up to three metres , creating a wall of rock above the epicentre . "" Our people have walked five kilometres so far and not found the end of this wall , "" she said . "" So far we have not gotten any reports of people getting swallowed up in these cracks ... the fault runs along a less - populated area . "" 
A photograph on the institute 's website shows part of the rock wall grotesquely rising on farmland behind an unscathed bamboo hut . 
Another house was shown lodged in a crack of the earth , while a big hole on the ground opened up at a banana farm . 
Head of the institute , Renato Solidum , says the ground fissures from the quake which killed 198 people on Bohol and two nearby islands , were among the largest recorded since the government agency began keeping quake records in 1987 . "" Most of our other quake records show a lateral ( sideways ) tearing of the earth , though we 've also had coral reefs rising from the sea , "" he said . 
President Benigno Aquino says the institute has assured him the worst is over , though Bohol will continue to be hit by aftershocks over the next few weeks . 
Mr Aquino , who slept in an army tent there overnight Wednesday in solidarity with the survivors , says "" there is no immediate danger "" either from the aftershocks or from the ground fissures . ","Philippines|0;13|0;0|LOC|loc

The European Union and the United Nations are coordinating international efforts to assist Albania after a 6.4 - magnitude earthquake struck Nov. 26 , affecting more than half of the country 's population . An EU team is leading the damage assessment and distribution of aid . 
Six EU member states have sent 50 structural engineers , with more to come , to assess the damage together with the local counterparts . “ In the midst of sorrow , grief and fear , this week has shown the unfailing links between Albanians and their friends in the EU , ” said Luigi Soreca , the EU ambassador to Albania . The U.S. Agency for International Development also has deployed structural engineers from the Fairfax County and Los Angeles County fire departments to assist with damage assessments . 
Olta Xhacka praised the international response so far , saying the 780 rescuers who rushed to the country right after the quake helped to prevent more deaths . The quake that hit Albania 's Adriatic coast also injured more than 3,000 people . 
Authorities give preliminary figures of 7,900 damaged buildings countrywide and more than 6,000 homeless sheltered in hotels , public buildings , tents and with relatives , while neighboring Kosovo has provided shelter to others . The quake has affected about 1.9 million people out of the country 's 2.8 million population , according to the EU office in the capital of Tirana . The worst - hit areas were the port town of Durres , a popular beach vacation spot for Albanians 33 kilometers ( 20 miles ) west of Tirana and the nearby northern town of Thumane . U.S. singer - songwriter Bebe Rexha visited Bubq village , 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) west of the capital Tirana , to hand out aid . Rexha , who is of ethnic Albanian origin , said she raised money through her fans to build two homes and is hoping to raise more . “ It 's really sad what 's happening here .

2013 Bushehr earthquake,4/9/2013,4/9/2013,"Quake hits near Iran's nuclear city Bushehr, 37 dead","DUBAI ( Reuters ) - A powerful earthquake struck close to Iran ’s only nuclear power station on Tuesday , killing 37 people and injuring 850 as it destroyed homes and devastated two small villages , Iranian media reported . 
The 6.3 magnitude quake totally destroyed one village , a Red Crescent official told the Iranian Students ’ News Agency ( ISNA ) , but the nearby Bushehr nuclear plant was undamaged , according to Iranian officials and the Russian company that built it . “ Due to the intensity of this earthquake , this tragedy has deepened and we have seen the destruction of many homes in the region , the deaths of 37 people and more than 850 injured , ” the governor of Bushehr province , Fereydoun Hassanvand , told Mehr news agency . 
Many houses in rural parts of the province are made of mud bricks , which have been known to crumble easily in quake - prone Iran . 
Some 700 homes were destroyed , Hassanvand said . 
Across the Gulf , offices in Qatar and Bahrain were evacuated after the quake , whose epicenter was 89 km ( 55 miles ) southeast of the port of Bushehr , according to the U.S. Geological Survey . 
The early afternoon shock was also felt in financial hub Dubai . 
The Russian company that built the nuclear power station , 18 km ( 11 miles ) south of Bushehr , said the plant was unaffected . “ Personnel continue to work in the normal regime and radiation levels are fully within the norm , ” Russian state news agency RIA quoted an official at Atomstroyexport as saying .

2013 Bushehr earthquake,4/9/2013,4/10/2013,"Fault Lines, Not Red Lines","Fault Lines , Not Red Lines A 6.3 - magnitude earthquake shook Iran ’s southern shores on Tuesday , April 9 , on the afternoon that the country was celebrating its National Nuclear Technology Day . 
Nearly 800 homes were destroyed , killing 37 people and injuring more than 900 . 
Iran ’s sole nuclear reactor , located in Bushehr , almost 100 miles from the quake ’s epicenter , was , according to Iranian and Russian officials , unaffected . 
But there ’s no way of knowing until the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) report comes out in May . 
Either way , they got lucky . The Bushehr reactor , which was completed in 2011 , sits at the intersection of three tectonic plates and is designed to endure earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.7 on the Richter scale . 
So this was a very close call for the hybrid German - Russian reactor — a virtual petri dish of amalgamated equipment and antiquated technology . 
The sui generis nature of the reactor means that Iran can not benefit from other countries ’ safety experiences . ","6.3 - magnitude|7 8 9|0|MAG|mag

2013 Bushehr earthquake,4/9/2013,4/9/2013,What Caused Iran's Deadly Earthquake?,"Crashing continents caused today 's ( April 9 ) deadly earthquake in Iran , which killed dozens , according to news reports . 
The magnitude - 6.3 Iran earthquake hit in the southern Zagros Mountains , a stunning range that marks the boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates , said Bill Barnhart , a research geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey 's ( USGS ) Denver office . 
The Arabian plate is grinding northward at about 0.4 inches ( 10 millimeters ) a year , pushing the boot - shaped Arabian peninsula into the Eurasian plate , which covers most of Europe and Asia . 
Just like the Himalaya Mountains , whose grand height and complex tectonics reflect the impact between the Indian and Eurasian plates , the Zagros Mountains are a mix of different earthquake fault styles , Barnhart told OurAmazingPlanet . 
Today ’s quake was a thrust fault earthquake , meaning the ground on one side of the fault moved vertically up and over the other side , shortening the distance between the two sides . 
The epicenter was 55 miles ( 89 kilometers ) southeast of Bushehr , the city where Iran 's only nuclear power station is located . 
The quake originated 6.2 miles ( 10 km ) below the Earth 's surface and struck at 4:22 p.m. local time ( 7:52 a.m. EDT ) , the USGS reported . ","today|3|0|TIME|None

It had a shallow depth of 6 miles ( 10 kilometres ) .

In Tijuana , a popular holiday resort for American students celebrating ' spring break ' , hundreds of people on the crowded beach feared the worst and fled when they felt the ground shake . 
Hernandez , the city fire department 's chief of aquatic rescue said no tsunami warning was issued and the beach filled up again within an hour .

More than 100 miles west of the epicenter , San Diego 's Sheraton Hotel and Marina was briefly evacuated after minor cracks were discovered in the floors , reported Fire - Rescue Department spokesman Maurice Luque .

( Source : AP Photo ) Indian soldiers inspect a house that collapsed in an earthquake in Imphal , capital of the northeastern Indian state of Manipur , Monday , Jan. 4 , 2016 . 
( Source : AP Photo ) Monday morning ’s tremor measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale that rocked the whole of north - eastern India and claimed at least eight lives , has one again brought into focus the high seismicity of the region which is even otherwise highly prone to various kinds of natural calamities including floods , river - bank erosion , landslides and forest fires . The North - east is located in Zone V – “ very severe intensity zone ” – and covers about 12 per cent of the country ’s total geographical area and about 11 per cent of the population . 
With the adjoining countries of Nepal , Bangladesh , Bhutan , China and Bangladesh sharing space in Zone V , what the North - east requires is a very well - drawn up disaster preparedness plan , apart from a detailed disaster mitigation policy comprising very strict construction by - laws . 
The region has experienced at least 18 severe earthquakes measuring above 7 on the Richter scale in the last 100 years . 
These include the ones that struck Shillong ( 1897 ) and Assam - Arunachal - Tibet ( 1950 ) , with the latter changing the course of many rivers including the Brahmaputra .

2017 Pohang earthquake,11/15/2017,,Earthquake Aftershocks: Unprecedented CSAT Postponement Catches Public Off-Guard,"SEOUL , Nov. 16 ( Korea Bizwire ) – While the city of Pohang and its surrounding regions continue to deal with aftershocks from the 5.4 - magnitude earthquake that struck the day before , the government delivered its own stunning blow by postponing the state - administered college entrance exam to November 23 . 
Originally scheduled to take place on November 16 , the government ’s decision shocked the public , as the college scholastic ability test ( CSAT ) has never before been delayed since it was first implemented in 1993 . 
The announcement was made late in the evening on November 15 , less than a day before the exams were to begin . A follow up announcement was made on November 16 that all dates relevant to the college application process were to be delayed by a week . 
Education officials convened an emergency session with postsecondary institution union heads in the morning to discuss the matter . 
A full postponement was deemed necessary due to the structured nature of the college application process . 
Under the initial arrangements , the following two weekends after the CSAT ( Nov. 18 - 19 , 25 - 26 ) were filled with college - administered testing and interviews . 
But once the test date was moved , postsecondary institutions became concerned that test takers would face too much pressure , as they would have to study for the college exams before preparing for the CSAT . ","SEOUL|0|0|LOC|None

2010 Chile earthquake,2/27/2010,3/1/2010,Chile quake 2010: Tsunami warning system worked as intended,"The Chile quake that struck Saturday and triggered a tsunami that traveled throughout the Pacific basin provided the first basin - wide test of the region 's tsunami-warning network in decades . 
By several accounts , the region - wide warning effort was a success , though in retrospect evacuations in many places far from the Chilean coast appear to have been excessive given the size of the surge that ultimately arrived . 
Initial estimates by state emergency officials in Hawaii reportedly put the size of arriving waves at between six and 10 feet . 
The waves that did arrive were less than three feet tall .

It was 35 inches ( 90 centimeters ) high . 
Another , measuring about 12 inches ( 30 centimeters ) , was observed in Hokkaido , also to the north . 
There were no reports of damage . 
As it crossed the Pacific , the tsunami has dealt populated areas - including the U.S. state of Hawaii - just a glancing blow . 
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center already lifted its warning for every country but Russia and Japan , though some countries in Asia and the Pacific - including the Philippines , Australia and New Zealand - were keeping their own watches in place as a precaution .

2010 Chile earthquake,2/27/2010,,Thousands begin evacuating in Japan as threat of tsunami nears,"Tokyo , Japan ( CNN ) -- 
Tens of thousands of residents began evacuating Sunday morning from coastal Japan in anticipation of a possible tsunami following Chile 's 8.8 - magnitude earthquake . 
The northern part of the main island was looking at the possibility of a tsunami at least 9 feet high , according to the Japan Meteorological Agency . 
Rail service was halted in coastal areas and residents were urged to evacuate low - lying areas of the island nation . 
The warning primarily affected fishing areas and tourist areas ; major cities like Tokyo , which is inland , were not affected . 
Sunday 's alert was Japan 's first major tsunami warning in more than 15 years , the agency reported . A tsunami spawned by Chile 's 1960 earthquake killed 140 people in Japan . On Saturday , tsunami warnings from Chile 's temblor initially covered the entire Pacific region , but they were canceled less than 18 hours later except for Russia , Japan and the Philippines . The Philippines Institute of Volcanology and Seismology issued a Level - 2 tsunami alert for the east coast of the Philippines . A Level - 2 alert means people are advised to stay away from the shoreline ; residents near coastal areas facing the Pacific Ocean are advised to go farther inland . 
Meanwhile , an official with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the island chain of Hawaii "" dodged a bullet "" after smaller - than - expected waves were reported . ","Tokyo|0;13|0;4|LOC|None

Most of the 800 people killed in the quake are now known to have died as a result of the tsunami , emergency officials said . 
The navy has already acknowledged that the warning it sent to President Michelle Bachelet lacked clarity . 
The alert was dropped after about 20 minutes as a "" false alarm , "" but by then hundreds of people had fled their homes on foot and in cars heading for higher ground . 
It was a further sign of the furious debate in Chile about how usual procedures in this quake - prone managed to break down . 
A series of contradictory orders from the president , senior navy officers and the Office of National Emergency ( ONEMI ) in the hours after the earthquake meant a tsunami alert was not immediately raised .

2010 Chile earthquake,2/27/2010,3/2/2010,Chile earthquake: Hillary Clinton arrives with satellite phones,"When the 8.8 Chilean earthquake struck , most authorities – including the Chilean government – underestimated the damage . By the next day , the death toll doubled to over 700 , and the nation learned that many coastal towns were destroyed not by the earth ’s movements but by giant waves generated in the aftermath . 
The reason for the miscalculation : there was no way to communicate from the hardest - hit areas . While clean water , food , medical support , and rescue workers are the priorities in the hours after a catastrophe , so too are phones – so that governments can properly assess the damage , dispatch officials to hot spots , and distribute aid to those most in need . 
Images from the magnitude - 8.8 earthquake in Chile So , after opening up to foreign aid assistance , Chile ’s first request to the US was communications equipment . 
And that ’s what US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , on part of a Latin America tour that was scheduled before the quake , has brought with her today as she visits Chile . "" They have asked for communications equipment , some of which I am bringing on our plane , "" Mrs. Clinton said in Montevideo Monday , with new Uruguayan President Jose Mujica at her side . 
Her load includes 20 satellite phones and a technician . 
One of the "" biggest problems has been communications as we found in Haiti in those days after the quake , ” she said . 
Clinton : US ' grateful ' for Chile 's help to Haiti Later Monday , speaking alongside President Michelle Bachelet in Chile 's capital , Santiago , Clinton said the US is "" grateful "" for what Chile did to help Haiti after that country 's devastating Jan. 12 earthquake .

In the days and weeks that have followed , geophysicists and geodesists , who study the Earth 's movement , have flocked to Chile 's "" rupture zone , "" a swath of vineyards and piney hills hammered by the quake . 
And more scientists are on the way , with the goal of picking up enough clues to one day predict when the next big one will strike . 
The country has a propensity for big quakes because of two huge underground plates crashing head on into each other . 
Among the first to arrive after the Feb. 27 quake was Jeff Genrich , a German - born geophysicist who works at the California Institute of Technology . 
With airports closed in Chile because of the quake , he flew to neighboring Argentina and then crossed the Andes overland . 
On a recent day , with a searing sun beating down , he tramped up the rocky foothills of the Andes not far from the hard - hit city of Talca . ","Chile|4;49;23;4|0;0;1;5|LOC|loc

2010 Chile earthquake,2/27/2010,2/27/2010,Chile earthquake much stronger than Haiti's but far less damage. Why?,"The earthquake that struck Chile was far stronger than the one that struck Haiti in January . 
But , initial reports show that damage was much more contained . 
While the death toll of 214 is only preliminary and is expected to grow , it ’s still a thousand times lower than that of Haiti ’s . 
One emergency official quoted by Reuters said the number of deaths was unlikely to increase dramatically . 
Images from the 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Chile Because of its long history with earthquakes , which has contributed to an earthquake “ consciousness ” in Chile , and infrastructure that is built to higher standards , many hope that Chile will be spared the vast destruction that struck Haiti , even as it deals with one of its worst natural disasters in decades . “ Chile has a long story of earthquakes , but I think this was the worst ever , ” says Paula Saez , an aid worker at World Vision in Chile . The 8.8 - magnitude quake that struck about 200 miles south of Santiago , is being billed as one of the world ’s largest in a century , but it will most likely not go down as one of the deadliest . 
In part , that ’s because Chile sits in the “ ring of fire ” earthquake zone and is accustomed to massive temblors , including the largest on record , which hit in 1960 and registered 9.5 . 
A few more days until full damage is known The government says that it might be another 72 hours before the real extent of the damage is known , as telecommunications are down in Concepcion , the city closest to the epicenter of the quake . ","Chile|4;7;26;40;66;95;6|0;4;4;4;4;4;5|LOC|loc

These preliminary measurements , produced from data gathered by researchers from four universities and several agencies , including geophysicists on the ground in Chile , paint a much clearer picture of the power behind this temblor , believed to be the fifth - most - powerful since instruments have been available to measure seismic shifts . 
Buenos Aires , the capital of Argentina and across the continent from the quake 's epicenter , moved about 1 inch to the west . 
And Chile 's capital , Santiago , moved about 11 inches to the west - southwest . 
The cities of Valparaiso and Mendoza , Argentina , northeast of Concepcion , also moved significantly .

The government also said a teacher and a Singaporean adventure guide perished , while another student and a teacher remained missing . "" Looking at the photos of these children , such young lives , full of promise , snuffed out , "" Mr Shanmugam said in a Facebook posting . 
Twenty - nine Singaporean and international students and eight teachers from Singapore 's Tanjong Katong Primary School ( TKPS ) were on a school excursion , climbing the popular peak , when Friday 's magnitude - 6.0 quake triggered massive landslides on the mountain . 
The earthquake on South - East Asia 's highest peak triggered a "" river of stones "" set loose by the large tremor . An 80 - member rescue team was dispatched on Sunday morning to search a section of trail on the popular climbing peak that was obliterated in rockfalls . 
Authorities have so far given few details on the victims or the scenes encountered by search crews on the mountain in Malaysia 's Sabah state on Borneo island , saying the poor state of some remains made identification difficult . 
But Malaysia 's The Star Online has released a photograph it claims is a list of the dead and missing , "" posted in the search and rescue operations room "" , which displays the details of seven Malaysians , nine Singaporeans , and one each from the Philippines , Japan and China .

Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines Members of the indigenous community in Sabah on the island of Borneo also blame the tourists for causing the earthquake , saying that their antics angered the spirit of the mountain . 
The earthquake , a 5.9 - magnitude tremor that occurred near Mount Kinabalu , came more than a week after the tourists photographed themselves standing naked on the mountain . 
The group of foreigners , which includes two Canadians , two Dutch and a German national , broke away from a larger party of tourists to take the photographs , which later appeared on social media . 
The Straits Times reported that a local tribal priest , known as the Bobolian , was demanding the tourists be fined 10 head of buffalo to appease the spirit of the mountain . "" The tourists who angered the guardian of the mountain should pay for their mistakes by giving sogit , "" the paper quoted Tindarama Aman Sirom Simbuna as saying , referring to what is typically an animal sacrifice to ' cool ' restless spirits .

2015 Sabah earthquake,6/5/2015,6/9/2015,To Trip or Not to Trip: Tribute to the Sabah Earthquake Victims,"Let ’s not get carried away by our grief and forget about the teachers ’ sacrifices or why such overseas learning journeys trips exist in the first place The dreadful magnitude 6.0 earthquake that struck Sabah ’s Mount Kinabalu , stealing the lives of 6 Tanjong Katong Primary School ( TKPS ) students , a teacher , and a guide , has undeniably shaken our nation to the core . 
However , alongside the outpouring of sympathy for the deceased and their families , has been a wave of discontent , and even anger . 
Many keyboard warriors – not the parents of the children – have questioned Tanjong Katong Primary School ( TKPS ) and the Ministry of Education ( MOE ) for allowing said students to go on the overseas leadership trip to Sabah . 
Among the hurtful comments : that teachers take on such trips because they are free holidays . 
Some even said that such trips were organised because of the principal ’s or teachers ’ “ ambitions ” and “ to meet their KPIs ( Key Performance Indictors ) ” , just to look good for their year - end review . These Are n’t Paid Holidays Firstly , this unfortunate and rare incident happened due to a natural disaster , something that no amount of planning on the teachers ’ part would have prevented . 
Despite accusations by keyboard warriors and dissenters that the teachers on the trip were on “ paid MOE holidays ’ , we at the UrbanWire , as students ourselves who have benefitted from such overseas learning journeys , know better and appreciate what teachers do for their charges . 
The teachers on this fateful climb up Mt Kinabalu , just like those who have brought us on our own trips , were n’t just educators . ","magnitude 6.0|30 31|0|MAG|mag

2015 Sabah earthquake,6/5/2015,6/12/2015,Malaysia fines and deports four tourists for stripping naked on sacred Mount Kinabalu in Sabah,"Western tourists were ordered to be deported from Malaysia on Friday after pleading guilty to obscenity charges for taking nude photos on a popular climbing peak , an act some in the country blamed for causing a deadly earthquake . 
The defendants — Eleanor Hawkins of Britain , 24 , Dutchman Dylan Snel , 23 , and Canadian brother and sister Lindsey , 23 , and Danielle Petersen , 22 — were arrested earlier this week in the wake of the deadly June 5 earthquake which killed 18 people on Mount Kinabalu . A court in Kota Kinabalu , capital of the state of Sabah on Borneo island , sentenced them to three days ’ jail time starting from when they were arrested on Tuesday , meaning their term had been served . 
They also were fined 5,000 Malaysian ringgit ( $ 1,330 ) and ordered deported for committing an “ obscene act in a public place , ” which can carry a three - month jail term . 
It was not immediately clear when they would be deported . 
“ It is a wake - up call to tourists not to ignore local traditions and culture , ” Masidi Manjun , the state ’s tourism minister , told AFP . “ Since they pleaded guilty and showed remorse , it is only fair that they are let off with a fine by the court . ” The 4,095 - metre ( 13,435 - foot ) peak , a World Heritage Site and popular climbing destination , is considered sacred to tribal groups on Borneo , and many Malaysians were incensed after the photos taken May 30 circulated on the internet . 
The four convicted Friday were among a larger group of tourists believed by authorities to have taken part . Police told AFP on Friday they were still seeking five others , but that some were thought to have left Sabah . 
The defendants were hustled into court through a media scrum including reporters from Britain who arrived in the sleepy state capital to follow Hawkins ’ fortunes . ","Malaysia|8|0|LOC|None

2011 Lorca earthquake,5/11/2011,5/12/2011,Destruction and shock in Spain's earthquake 'hot zone',"Destruction and shock in Spain 's earthquake ' hot zone ' The shocks damaged more than 22,000 buildings in the Spanish town Continue reading the main story Related Stories Eight people have died in the Magnitude 5.2 Lorca earthquake , with many more injured by falling debris . A magnitude five earthquake occurs somewhere in the world around three times a day , and the earthquake in Lorca was about 1,000 times smaller than the recent Tohoku quake in Japan . 
But Spain is a relatively low risk country for quakes , and buildings are not generally constructed to protect against seismic shaking . 
Having said that , the Murcia region is the most seismically active in the country , and some of the medieval buildings that were badly damaged in this event may have been weakened by past earthquakes in the area . 
This event was particularly damaging because it occurred at a relatively shallow depth , about 10 km ( six miles ) below the Earth 's surface . 
Roger Musson from the British Geological Survey said it appears to have occurred along a fault line running from south - west to north - east . Dr Musson told BBC 
News the quake was caused by an oblique slip movement , which means that rocks moved sideways and upwards along the fault . 
Seismologists have reported that the 5.2 shock in Lorca was preceded by a Magnitude 4.5 event about two hours previously . ","Spain|4;1|0;1|LOC|None

Most of the reported fatalities were in villages and towns east of Kathmandu , only just beginning to pick up the pieces from the April 25 quake that left more than 8,000 dead . The U.S. military ’s Pacific Command said a Marine Corps helicopter involved in disaster relief had gone missing , with six U.S. Marines and two Nepalese soldiers aboard . 
The new 7.3 magnitude quake was centred 76 km ( 47 miles ) east of the capital in a hilly area close to the border with Tibet , according to coordinates provided by the U.S. Geological Survey , and unleashed landslides in Himalayan valleys near Mount Everest . 
Villagers who watched their homes collapse said they only survived because they were already living in tents . 
Aid workers reported serious damage to some villages in the worst - affected Charikot area and said some people were still trapped under rubble . 
Witnesses said rocks and mud came crashing down remote hillsides lined with roads and small hamlets .

2015 Nepal earthquake,5/12/2015,5/14/2015,Seismically Speaking: What is happening in Nepal?,"Quite clearly , nature is not giving the Himalayan Kingdom any respite , 81 years after the last major earthquake in the region - the ‘ North Bihar - Nepal Earthquake ’ of 1934 . 
In the Seismic Zones Map of India of 1972 , which is currently being followed ( with a modification ) , Nepal falls in Zone 5 ( See Picture ) . 
All the places located in Zone 5 carry the tag of a Magnitude 8 earthquake . 
So the 7.9 Magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal at Lamjung , 77 km to the northwest of Kathmandu on April 25 only validated the seismic zoning . 
It will be seen from the portion of the map presented that there are five disconnected ’ islands ’ of Zone 5 , occurring on the base of Zone 4 , from Kashmir to the northeastern states , all of which constitute the largest region of Zone 5 . Seismicity of the Himalayan Region and Nepal The high seismicity of the sub-Himalayan arc is attributed to the slow northerly movement of the Indian ‘ tectonic ’ plate at rates ranging between 48 mm and 53 mm per year , in its attempt to get thrust under the continental massif to the north - the Tibetan Plateau in the case of Nepal . 
This is called ‘ subduction ’ in Plate Tectonics and results in a massive collision of two opposing continental blocks , leading to the release of earthquake energy through the already - existing weak planes in the rocks of the region that go by the name ‘ thrust faults ’ . 
Three such features have been mapped all along the sub-Himalayan region , namely , the Main Frontal Thrust ( MFT ) , the Main Boundary Thrust ( MBT ) and the Main Central Thrust ( MCT ) . ","the Himalayan|7 8;51 52|0;4|LOC|None

Striking around dawn while many locals were at home , the quake collapsed buildings in Jiegu Township , near the epicenter , trapping hundreds under rubble , Huang Limin , deputy secretary - general of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture , told the state - run Xinhua News Agency . 
More than 85 percent of the houses in Jiegu , a town of 100,000 people , were destroyed , Zhuo Huaxia , a prefectural official told Xinhua : 
"" The streets in Jiegu are thronged with panicked , injured people , with many bleeding in the head . 
Many students are buried under the debris due to building collapse at a vocational school . ""

A day ’s drive from main airport By early evening , some rescue teams able to land at the damaged airport in Yushu , in southwestern Qinghai , were trying to deliver the first emergency medical supplies , food , and tents , China Central Television said . 
Other teams will have to make their way 18 hours through the mountains by automobile from the capital Xining , in the northeastern part of the province , CCTV said .

2010 Yushu earthquake,4/14/2010,,Chinese rescuers impeded by earthquake damage,"Jiegu , China ( CNN ) -- 
Unstable bridges and collapsed roadways kept rescuers and their heavy equipment away Thursday from Jiegu , China -- the town nearest the epicenter of a 6.9 magnitude earthquake that killed nearly 600 people and injured thousands more . 
Twenty - four hours after the Wednesday quake , most of Jiegu 's dead were in the dusty rubble of a hotel that crumbled under the strain of the initial quake and a series of strong aftershocks . 
Residents painstakingly picked through the debris with shovels and ropes , ever mindful that time is a formidable obstacle to finding survivors . "" We have to mainly rely on our hands to clear away the debris as we have no large excavating machines , "" police officer Shi Huajie told the state - run news agency Xinhua . 
Injured survivors are n't clear of difficulty either -- the remote , mountainous and impoverished region in Qinghai province has few doctors and rapidly dwindling medical supplies . 
And then there was the lack of electrical power -- the quakes cracked a hydroelectric power plant , forcing authorities to shut it down , making even a nearby airport unusable until portable generators could go online .

The government has responded energetically to the crisis , deploying some 15,000 rescuers to the quake zone , including 11,000 police officers and soldiers . 
So many military supply trucks are heading to the hard - hit town of Jiegu that traffic on the main road has backed up for miles , reported the Associated Press .

2010 Yushu earthquake,4/14/2010,,China urges Tibetan monks to leave quake zone,"Thousands of monks flocked to Yushu in the wake of last week 's 7.1 - magnitude quake , which killed over 2,187 people . 
As official rescue teams struggled to reach the remote region , teams of monks saved huge numbers of lives in the immediate aftermath of the quake . "" I commend the monastic community for their good neighbourly support and assistance to the families of those who have lost everything , "" said the Dalai Lama , the spiritual leader of the Tibetans . 
However , the presence of thousands of monks in Yushu , a predominately ethnic Tibetan region , appears to have made the Chinese government uneasy . 
Chinese media coverage of the quake carried few images of monks doing rescue work and monks were conspicuously absent from the memorial service for the victims of the quake . 
Now , China 's State Council has said monks should leave the area and allow relief teams to take over their work . "" The duties of rescue workers in the quake zone are basically over , and the focus has moved to disease prevention and reconstruction , which need specialised people , "" the State Council said in a statement . "" While fully recognising the positive contributions of the monks that came from other areas , we suggested to them that they return to their monasteries to ensure the high effectiveness and order of quake relief work , "" it said . 
The government remains unsure of the monks in the wake of widespread riots in 2008 against Chinese rule . "" The government 's attitude is that the lamas are an unstable element , this is especially so following the unrest , "" said Woeser , a leading Tibetan activist . 
She said monks had been told to leave as "" they had already done too much and that if they stayed it could become troublesome . "" ","Thousands|0|0|NUM|None

Credit : NEWSCOM The deadly earthquake that hit western China earlier this month may have put more stress on a nearby fault , increasing the risk of another quake in the devastated region , according to researchers who have been analysing the event . 
At 7:49 local time on 14 April , an earthquake recorded as magnitude 6.9 by the US Geological Survey struck the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai . 
As of 20 April , the death toll had reached 2,046 , with 12,135 people injured and 193 missing , according to official figures . 
Geologists familiar with the Chinese region say it is possible that April 's quake may increase the risk of a future earthquake on another fault . 
"" If there is a major seismic hazard in the foreseeable future , the people in the region need to know , "" says Jian Lin , a geophysicist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Cape Cod , Massachusetts . 
The earthquake resulted from a type of fault movement known as strike - slip , in which the two sides of the fault move horizontally past each other . ","thousands|9|0|NUM|death

Two people found dead in coastal town of Kaikoura and Mt Lyford ski resort Two people found dead in coastal town of Kaikoura and Mt Lyford ski resort Road , rail links close after land slippages and cracking With communications cut off , emergency response teams were flying by helicopter to the region at the epicentre of the magnitude - 7.8 quake , about 90 kilometres north - east of Christchurch in the South Island , amid reports of injuries and collapsed buildings . A second earthquake , initially measured as magnitude 6.8 but revised down to 6.2 , struck the South Island hours afterward , but there were no reports of deaths or injuries . 
Hours after the initial quake , Marlborough District Council warned residents to flee to high ground immediately after a Slip Dam on the Clarence River breached , sending a large wall of water downstream . 
Two people were killed in the quake , with Prime Minister John Key telling reporters authorities had no reason to believe the death toll would rise . "" On the very best information we have at the moment , we think it 's only likely to be two , "" Mr Key said . "" But of course there are isolated parts of the country which we do n't have perfect eyes on , so we ca n't be 100 per cent sure . "" 
Loading New Zealand 's Geonet measured the first quake at magnitude 7.5 , while the US Geological Survey put it at 7.8 . Mr Key said officials had decided not to declare a national emergency because the nation 's regions were able to adequately cope with the situation .

It all happened so fast , the exposed sea bed was still crawling in sea life when locals discovered their newly remodelled coastline , and scientists have never seen anything like it . "" I ’ve never seen it before during an earthquake and it ’s the first time we ’ve seen something like this , "" marine geologist Joshu Mountjoy from New Zealand ’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research told Stuff .

Credit : Anna Redmond / Facebook Monday ’s earthquake really took its toll on central New Zealand , leaving more than 1,000 locals and tourists stranded by landslides , with two people reported dead , and dozens injured . 
The effects were so intense because two almost simultaneous tremors had ruptured fault lines across the top of the country ’s South Island just after midnight . 
There are now fears that the strength of the aftershocks could be indications of another earthquake - and it could occur at any point in the next 30 days . 
Mountjoy suspects that the unique nature of the earthquake is behind the eerie exposure of the sea bed in the coastal town of Kaikoura , saying a phenomenon called co-seismic movement was likely in play . ","magnitude 7.8|1 2|0|MAG|mag

2016 Kaikoura earthquake,11/14/2016,,New Zealand quake: The cut-off tourist town of Kaikoura,"AP The tourists are gone , the town is cut off and the sewage is backing up , but businesses in quake - hit Kaikoura are vowing to struggle on . The town was cut off from the rest of New Zealand 's South Island when a magnitude 7.8 earthquake destroyed its roads and railway on 14 November . 
Nearly two weeks later there is still no easy way in or out of the town and its biggest industries - fishing , agriculture and tourism - have ground to an agonising halt , just as it was preparing for peak visitor season . 
Image caption Restoring road access is the highest priority for many "" Quite literally , the money has just stopped coming in , "" said Matt Foy , the founder of Kaikoura Kayaks . "" We 've had a couple of tours out with people who were stranded here who have nothing else to do , but at this time of year we should be absolutely heaving . "" 
Like many in the town , he is relying on government assistance , considerate banks and donations . A town which relies on tourism , farming and fishing is now struggling to find a way forward . "" I hear that people are milking their cows and the milk is going down the drain because there are no tankers coming in to pick that milk up , "" said Mr Foy . 
Image caption Shellfish lie dead where they once would have been underwater Ben Dalton , deputy director - general at New Zealand 's Ministry for Primary Industries ( MPI ) said that for the next three months "" we have a ban on the taking of paua [ abalone ] , seaweed and shellfish , and a one - month ban on the taking of crayfish "" . 
The halt is to allow their populations to recover after the sea bed rose "" up to 4 m "" ( 13 ft ) in places , stranding and killing huge numbers of the animals .

Now that it has been a little over 48 hours since the quake , we know more about it , and where damage is concentrated , allowing us to develop hypotheses about what may have happened . 
An astonishing foreshock sequence In a typical aftershock sequence , the rate of earthquakes steadily declines . 
However , in the figure below , a time series shows that approximately 12 hours prior to the M=6.4 on Tuesday , the rate of earthquakes began increasing . 
While the exact reason for this increase is unclear , it should be noted that there is no increase in GPS velocities associated with the building in quake rates . 
An additional factor regarding the aftershock sequences is the distribution of earthquakes .

The city , which is about 219 km from the capital , Port - au - Prince , was hardest hit by Saturday 's quake , which authorities say injured 188 people . 
At the Immaculate Conception Hospital , doctors and nurses lack the supplies they need to treat those wounded by the magnitude 5.9 quake and efforts are further frustrated by electricity outages and damage to the hospital building . "" There was no electricity here , so we could n't receive the huge numbers that came last night , "" Paul Miclaude , a doctor working in the emergency room , told the AFP news agency . "" It was really difficult for us to send them to another hospital . 
With time running out , some died here . "" {articleGUID } According to Haitian officials , eight of the 12 victims died in Port - de - Paix . "" Clearly , we are n't ready for such a catastrophe , "" said Miclaude . By Monday , patients were receiving drips on mattresses lined up on the ground outside the hospital . "" With all the aftershocks , we ca n't really stay inside . 
We 're putting up tents to receive the patients , "" said Polycarpe Saeely , the hospital 's medical chief . A strong magnitude - 5.2 aftershock on Sunday followed the earthquake as several crates of medicine arrived from the health ministry , sending doctors and patients running from the hospital , fearful that part of the building would collapse . "" Everyone can see that we do n't have a real hospital , "" said Francois Lubernsron , a 28 - year - old Port - de - Praix resident .

2017 Ischia earthquake,8/21/2017,8/23/2017,Italy's deadly flirtation with illegal building,"ROME ( AFP ) - As Italy reels from another earthquake , experts warned on Wednesday ( Aug 23 ) that widespread illegal construction is putting millions across the country at risk of being killed . 
The tremor that shook the island of Ischia on Monday , toppling houses and killing two women , has sparked much soul - searching in a country with a weakness for rule - breaking - particularly when it comes to building or renovating houses . 
Geologists insisted that the relatively minor 4.0 magnitude quake should not have killed anyone and the civil protection agency laid the blame on the "" many structures built with shoddy and illegal materials "" on the island . 
Residents there have put in 28,000 requests for amnesties for infringement of building regulations in the last 30 years . 
Attempts by the council to tear down illegal constructions have sparked fury , with locals clashing with riot police . 
The same battle is waged daily across Italy - predominantly in the poorer south , the playground of Italy 's mafias . 
The mayor of Licata in Sicily was ousted this month by councillors infuriated by his campaign against illegal housing . ","ROME|0|0|LOC|None

2017 Ischia earthquake,8/21/2017,8/23/2017,Three children saved after Ischia earthquake,"2,500 people displaced as tourists flee holiday island . 
Rescue teams worked around the clock on 22 August to save three brothers trapped under the rubble of a collapsed house in Ischia , following a 4.0 magnitude earthquake the evening before . 
The quake hit the holiday island in the Bay of Naples during peak tourist season , killing two women and leaving around 40 injured . 
There are reports that 2,500 people have been displaced and that tourists have fled the island en masse . 
However there were moments of joy on 22 August when firefighters managed to rescue a seven- month - old baby from the rubble , followed by the safe return of his brothers , aged 8 and 11 . There is speculation in Italian media that the collapsed houses may have been constructed using poor building materials and without adequate authorisation - a widespread problem in the southern Campania region of which the island belongs . 
The Ischia earthquake struck as Italy prepares to remember the 299 victims killed in the 6.0 magnitude quake that hit the central Apennines around Amatrice and Accumoli on 24 August 2016 . 
The area of Ischia worst hit was the village of Casamicciola , near the mid-north coast , however the quake did not affect La Mortella gardens , an oasis of tropical and Mediterranean plants , located on the island 's north - west coast . ","2,500 people|0 1;4 5|0;3|NUM|None

The building , built in 1994 , withstood a 1999 earlier earthquake , but was the only high - rise in Tainan to collapse in Saturday ’s quake . 
The government is now investigating to see whether shoddy construction contributed to the collapse . 
Photos of the collapsed building show cans marked “ Alesco , ” a Japanese brand of paint , lined up between the collapsed concrete walls ( the blue and white cans in the photo above ) . 
News reports said that cooking oil cans were used as construction materials as well .

2016 Taiwan earthquake,2/6/2016,,Recent Taiwan earthquake impact larger than expected,"Damage to Fab 14 may affect iPhone 7 production A recent 6.4 - magnitude earthquake in the southern Taiwan region that killed at least 116 people was originally expected to have a less than 1 percent impact on semiconductor manufacturing in the region . 
TSMC now expects to have an impact above 1 percent , according to an updated report from DigiTimes . 
Image Source : Earthquake - Report Taiwan Semiconductor 
Manufacturing Company , headquartered in northern Taiwan ’s Hsinchu City , had originally estimated that wafer shipments in Q1 2016 will decrease less than 1 percent due to the February 6th earthquake hitting the southern Taiwan region . 
As of February 12th , TSMC now estimates that wafer shipments will decrease more than 1 percent because damage to Fab 14 is worse than originally assessed . TSMC 's Fab 14 in Tainan , southern Taiwan “ TSMC originally estimated that more than 95 % of foundry machines could be restored to normal conditions in 2 - 3 days following the earthquake , ” reports DigiTimes . 
“ Machines at Fab 6 and Fab 14B have already been fully restored , the company said . ” 
The fabrication giant operates its 300 - millimeter ( 12 - inch ) Fab 14 in the Tainan Science - Based Industrial Park in southern Taiwan , where it became first in the world to manufacture 20 - nanometer SoCs in 2014 , including the Apple A8 processor for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus .

2016 Taiwan earthquake,2/6/2016,2/15/2016,"Apple chipmaker TSMC says earthquake damage will hit production, full impact unclear as yet","Apple chipmaker TSMC said that the earthquake that hit southern Taiwan earlier this month caused damage that will impact production , but has not yet given a clear indication of the scale of the problem . 
The company is one of two chip fabricators for the iPhone 6s , and is expected to be the sole manufacturer of the A10 chip for the iPhone 7 . The 6.4 - magnitude earthquake on February 6 killed 116 people and injured many more , with significant damage also caused to manufacturing facilities … TSMC initially said that it expected 95 % of production capacity to be restored within 2 - 3 days , and that the long - term impact would be a loss of around 1 % of 2016 production . 
However , Digitimes now reports the company says that damage to one of the chip- fabrication facilities is “ worse than originally assessed . ” 
The company has , however , indicated that it is “ confident ” of hitting its revenue targets for the first quarter of the year , suggesting that it still expects the impact to be relatively minor . 
It had been speculated that Apple ’s reported decision to switch from a TSMC / Samsung mix for the A9 chip to TSMC only for the A10 may have been influenced by benchmark tests showing that iPhone 6s models equipped with the TSMC chip ran cooler and offered better battery life than Samsung variants . 
Apple played down the differences , saying that benchtests are not typical of real - world usage , and that the difference amounted to 2 - 3 % .

2016 Taiwan earthquake,2/6/2016,2/10/2016,Taiwan Earthquake 2016 Updates: Tin Cans Used in Construction of Collapsed Apartment Building,"Immediately after a magnitude 6.4 earthquake shook Taiwan , rescue workers descended upon the city of Tainan , where a 17 - story apartment building collapsed on Feb . 
6 . During their rescue efforts , the workers came across the ruins of the building and were surprised to see tin cans lining the interior of its smashed pillars . Based on eyewitness accounts and photos from the site , officials were able to confirm that tin cans for cooking oil were used in the construction of the Weiguan Jinlong building 's beams . 
Following the disaster , an investigation was launched regarding the structural stability of the apartment which led to the arrest of the executives of the Weiguan company , according to the International Business Times . The executives , including Chang Kui-an , Chen Chin - Kui and former chairman Lin Ming - hui , have been charged with professional negligence resulting in death . 
However , it is still unconfirmed if the charges are related to the use of tin cans since according to a structural engineer , these may have only been used for aesthetic purposes . The engineer , Tai Yun - fa , told China 's Central News Agency that before Taiwan was hit by a magnitude 7.3 earthquake in 1999 , cans were commonly used in the construction of buildings in the country . 
The purpose of these is to act as fillers to make the pillars appear thicker . Since the Weiguan Jinlong apartment was erected in 1983 , it did not come as a surprise that its beams had cans inside them . 
He noted that these were probably just added for aesthetic purposes and not for structural support . However , despite the legality of using tin cans , victims from the collapsed building ca n't help but blame its developers for what happened . 
As pointed out by Elise Hu , a correspondent for NPR , the apartment complex was the only building that fell in the area . ","magnitude 6.4|3 4|0|MAG|mag

Epicentre The Council for Geoscience said its epicentre was in the Orkney region in North West , where one person was killed . “ It occurred in the Stilfontein , Klerksdorp and Orkney region and it was quite widely felt … as far as the Eastern Cape , ” said the Council for Geoscience ’s Michelle Grobbelaar . 
She said more tremors , aftershocks and possibly a second quake of the same magnitude were expected , but could not say when . “ We are monitoring . 
It will continue for days , if not months , ” said Grobbelaar . “ More tremors are expected . 
We can expect one of the same magnitude in the future , we just do n’t know when . 
We can not predict . ” Citizens in Gauteng , Kwa Zulu - Natal and the Free State reported feeling the quake . 
Single casualty ER24 spokesperson Luyanda Majija said the body of a 31 - year - old man was found in an old mining village in Orkney following the quake . ","One person|0 1|0|NUM|death

2018 Anchorage earthquake,11/30/2018,,Anchorage Building Codes Credited for Limited Damage After Quakes,"The magnitudes 7.0 and 5.7 earthquakes that struck Anchorage , Alaska , on Nov. 30 shook buildings and shattered highways , but caused limited structural damage and no reported loss of life , mostly due to the depth and location of the quake ’s epicenter , as well as the city and state ’s stringent building requirements . 
Most buildings in the southern Alaska city of about 300,000 are less than 20 - 30 years old , and local amendments to the already strict International Building Code further regulate the building of structures in Anchorage , requiring in - depth soil analyses and designs that accommodate seismic loads . 
The 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit seven miles north of Anchorage at 8:29 a.m. at a depth of about 27 miles , followed six minutes later by a 5.7 aftershock . 
The quakes also briefly triggered a tsunami warning . 
The event served as a test of seismic design standards established in the decades following a devastating 9.2 magnitude temblor and resulting tsunami in 1964 that killed more than 100 people in the Anchorage area and destroyed several small coastal towns . 
“ That was a wake - up call for the engineering community , ” says Sterling Strait , a member of the Alaska Seismic Hazards Safety Commission . 
“ Up to that point , there had not been a lot of emphasis placed on seismic design . ” ","magnitudes 7.0|1 2|0|NUM|mag
