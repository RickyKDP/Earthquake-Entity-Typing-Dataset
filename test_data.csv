2011 Sikkim earthquake,9/18/2011,,Sikkim quake: Death toll rises; losses estimated at Rs 1 lakh crore,"Four days after a devastating earthquake measuring a forceful 6.8 on the Richter scale struck large parts of north east India , rescue and relief teams are still trying to reach thousands of people trapped in remote areas . 
Many villages in quake - hit Sikkim are still out of reach and thousands are said to be waiting for help . 
Rescue operations remain the biggest challenge as rain and landslides are severely hampering the efforts and bad weather is not allowing helicopters to land . 
Sikkim Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling on Wednesday visited the quake - affected areas including Nanduk - one of the worst - hit villages - which is an hour 's drive from the capital Gangtok . 
There were about 25 houses in this village but the powerful quake razed the entire village to the ground . 
Fortunately , no casualties were reported . 
I think loss and damage will be not less than Rs one lakh crore . ","Four|0|0|TIME|None

2011 Sikkim earthquake,9/18/2011,9/20/2011,Rescuers push into Himalayan quake 'ground zero',"By AFP Rescue teams faced a grim search for victims Tuesday as they converged on the remote epicentre of a powerful Himalayan earthquake that killed at least 67 people in India , Nepal and Tibet . 
After a day spent battling landslides and heavy rains , the relief effort regrouped for an even tougher push into the mountainous northern region of India 's Sikkim state , where Sunday 's 6.9 - magnitude earthquake hit on the border with Nepal . 
Rescuers were hoping for a break in the weather that would allow them to fly in crucial supplies and personnel by helicopters that were largely grounded Monday by monsoon downpours and low cloud . "" The biggest challenge now is to get the rescue teams to the affected areas , "" said Sikkim Information Minister C.B. Karki . The death toll from building collapses and landslides in Sikkim stood at 35 , but Indian Home Secretary R.K . 
Singh warned the number could rise as emergency relief workers reached far - flung villages in the quake 's main impact zone . "" We can not rule out more casualties , "" Singh told a news briefing in New Delhi . 
The few helicopter sorties carried out on Monday did manage to drop some food packages , and ferried two small medical teams with doctors and paramedics into the worst - affected districts of Mangan and Sangthan . 
But the majority of rescue workers faced a gruelling 60 - kilometre ( 37 - mile ) journey by land from Sikkim 's state capital Gangtok along rough , badly damaged roads , more often frequented by groups of adventurous tourists heading for Himalayan trekking trails . 
More than 5,000 army troops were mobilised across the state to help clear roads and assist with the relief operation . The Press Trust of India said 26 tourists , including 15 trekkers , had been rescued and taken to army encampments for their own safety . ","Tuesday|10|0|TIME|None

2011 Sikkim earthquake,9/18/2011,9/24/2011,What They Said: Sikkim Earthquake,"More than 100 people were killed after a 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the northeast Indian state of Sikkim on Sunday . 
Over 5,000 army personnel , 7,000 Indo - Tibetan border police officials and five relief teams of the National Disaster Response Force were deployed for rescue operations . 
Here is a roundup of what several Indian newspapers and commentators had to say about the earthquake and it s aftermath : Agence France - Presse / Getty Images Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi and Sikkim Chief Minister Pawan Chamling stood with officials as they inspected damaged homes on the outskirts of Gangtok on Monday . 
In a Tuesday editorial titled “ Disaster response : Much to be done ” the Asian Age said that although India has dedicated emergency response teams , there is a sense that they do n’t automatically click into gear when disaster strikes . “ There should have been , for instance , no cause for the official announcement that the Prime Minister himself has decided to oversee the post -earthquake response of the various agencies at work . 
In a situation after an earthquake or any other natural disaster , the routine should be set and known to all — just as it is when a crime is committed or a serious traffic accident occurs , ” it said . “ While there is no guard against nature ’s fury , and no way to anticipate it , by now we do know enough about what to do when earthquakes and floods strike . ” A Wednesday editorial in The Times of India headlined “ Wake up Call ” raised critical concerns on India ’s preparedness to deal with high intensity quakes . 
It said that though a host of safety regulations existed on paper , enforcement was flawed . 
“ Earthquake engineering codes and quake - safe construction guidelines have been laid down by government bodies . ","More than 100 people|0 1 2 3|0|NUM|death

2013 Balochistan earthquakes,9/24/2013,9/24/2013,Deadly earthquake in Pakistan causes new island to emerge,"A massive earthquake struck near the southern coast of Pakistan today , killing upwards of 100 people , injuring dozens more , and leading to the formation of a small rocky island , according to multiple reports . 
The epicenter of the 7.7 - magnitude quake was in the district of Awaran , a remote and mountainous area where at least 45 people were killed , the BBC said . 
Another 150 died in the nearby Balochistan province , according to Pakistan 's Express Tribune newspaper . 
The island , which is reportedly about 30 feet high and nearly 100 feet in diameter , is located in the Arabian Sea nearly a mile off the nation 's shoreline . 
More than 1,000 could be dead Zahid Rafi , a principal seismologist at Pakistan 's National Seismic Monitoring Center , told CNN that the island 's formation was "" not surprising , "" given how powerful the earthquake was .

Naseer Ahmed / Reuters Survivors of a 7.7 - magnitude earthquake that hit a remote region in Pakistan 's province of Balochistan Tuesday wait in searing heat for government aid to arrive as more than 100,000 people have been left homeless by the disaster , which has killed at least 515 people . 
Babar Yaqoob , chief secretary of Balochistan , gave the updated death toll Friday as he was touring the destroyed district of Awaran , where the earthquake struck . 
Survivors spent another night in the open or under makeshift shelters Thursday night as response teams struggled to reach the remote region in the southwestern province . 
The population of Awaran is scattered over more than 13,000 square miles of rugged terrain , where infrastructure is limited and there are few medical facilities or even roads . 
Deadly earthquake strikes Pakistan Desperate conditions Al Jazeera 's Kamal Hyder , reporting from Awaran Thursday , said conditions were desperate among the survivors and many were going without food , water and shelter , having lost everything in the quake .

2013 Balochistan earthquakes,9/24/2013,9/27/2013,Pakistan’s “Earthquake Island” Seen From Space,"On the afternoon of Tuesday September 24 , 2013 , a 7.7 - magnitude earthquake struck Balochistan province in southern Pakistan , causing widespread destruction across several districts during more than 2 minutes of powerful tremors and shaking . 
Sadly at least 400 people were killed ( some reports say 600 ) and over 100,000 have been left homeless . 
But a weirder — if much less tragic — effect of the quake that was soon reported worldwide was the sudden appearance of a new island off the coast , a mound of mud and bubbling methane seeps rising nearly 20 meters ( 70 feet ) from the ocean surface . 
The image above , taken by NASA ’s Earth Observing - 1 satellite , shows the newly - formed mud island a kilometer ( 0.6 miles ) off the Gwadar coast . 
According to an article by the Pakistani news site Dawn.com , the 250 - by - 100 - foot - long pile of mud and rocks is leaking flammable gases . “ Our team found bubbles rising from the surface of the island which caught fire when a match was lit and we forbade our team to start any flame , ” said Mohammad Danish , a marine biologist from Pakistan ’s National Institute of Oceanography . 
“ It is methane gas . ” Pakistan ’s many earthquakes are the result of collisions between the Indian , Arabian , and Eurasian tectonic plates .

2013 Balochistan earthquakes,9/24/2013,9/28/2013,The ticking time bomb beneath Quetta,"The Awaran district in Balochistan is the worst affected area of the September 24 , 2013 earthquake . 
Killing at least 359 people , the massive quake razed homes and destroyed the district 's infrastructure ; tremors also affected dozens of towns in six other districts of the province . 
Days after the earthquake , owing to severe damages to communication means and militancy , the survivors are still awaiting relief and rehabilitation . 
According to the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) , the quake measured 7.7 on the Richter scale , with the epicenter laying 96 kilometres north of Awaran at a depth of 20 kilometres – and was the result of the very active Chaman fault . 
The jolts were felt across Pakistan , prompting people in many cities , like Karachi , Hyderabad , Quetta and Kashmir to evacuate homes and offices . 
Both , the April 2013 earthquake in Mashkhel and the September 2013 earthquake in Awaran have raised concerns about the threat of a massive impending earthquake , specifically in the Quetta region . 
The calm before the storm Din Muhammad Kakar , Assistant Professor in Geology at the University of Balochistan warns that elevated stress in the faults near Quetta is a strong indicator of an imminent earthquake . ","The Awaran|0 1|0|LOC|None

2011 Van earthquakes,10/23/2011,10/24/2011,Turkey's Deadly Earthquake Explained,"The magnitude 7.2 earthquake that rattled eastern Turkey on Sunday ( Oct. 23 ) was a rare , powerful temblor for the area , but not entirely a surprise given the web of active faults in the region , earthquake scientists say . 
Turkey rumbles often and has seen many destructive earthquakes throughout recorded history . 
The last major quake to strike the country was the Izmit earthquake of 1999 , a magnitude 7.6 to the west of the Oct. 23 quake , which killed 17,000 people , injured 50,000 and left 500,000 homeless . 
Magnitude 7 earthquakes do n't happen very often in the area , but that does n't mean it 's surprising to see one there . "" We pretty much expect this sort of thing , "" said Don Blakeman , a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden , Colo . The Oct. 23 quake struck in the afternoon , about 9 miles ( 16 kilometers ) north - northeast of the city of Van . 
The quake ruptured 12.4 miles ( 20 km ) underground . 
In Eastern Turkey , the Arabian Plate — a huge slab of the Earth 's crust — is slowly smashing into the Eurasian Plate at a speed of less than 1 inch per year ( 24 millimeters per year ) . 
In Western and Central Turkey the movement is different , and the evidence of the country 's complex tectonics is seen in the east - west running mountain range of western Turkey and the north - south mountains to the east , Blakeman said . ","magnitude 7.2|1 2|0|MAG|mag

News correspondent Mark Phillips reports that the ground shook for thirty seconds . 
The quake was strong enough to cause serious damage , and be felt over an area of hundreds of square miles . 
It was also shallow enough -- about fifteen miles below the surface -- to cause maximum casualties , and panic among local residents . 
Reuters is reporting that Interior Minister Idris Naim Sahin said the 7.2 magnitude quake on Sunday killed 100 in the city of Van and 117 in the badly hit town of Ercis , 60 miles further north .

2011 Van earthquakes,10/23/2011,,Turkey earthquake reveals a new active fault zone,"( Image : KeystoneUSA - ZUMA / Rex Features ) An earthquake of magnitude 7.2 struck Turkey yesterday , killing more than 200 people and injuring thousands . 
Turkey is one of the most quake - prone countries in the world . 
Most of it lies on the Anatolian plate , a small wedge - shaped tectonic plate that is being squeezed westwards as the Arabian plate to the east slams into the Eurasian plate . 
Many of Turkey ’s most severe quakes occur on one of the two faults that flank the Anatolian plate – the north and the east Anatolian faults . 
Between 1939 and 1999 Turkey ’s major earthquakes were marching westward along the north Anatolian fault , prompting fears that Istanbul – which lies near the fault – would eventually shake . 
In 1999 a magnitude - 7.6 quake struck near Izmit , just 70 kilometres from Istanbul , killing around 17,000 people . 
Advertisement Since 2003 , however , activity has shifted to the east Anatolian fault . ","magnitude 7.2|13 14|0|MAG|mag

2011 Van earthquakes,10/23/2011,,A Geologist's-Eye-View of the Van Earthquake,"The death toll from Sunday 's magnitude 7.2 earthquake in the Van Province in eastern Turkey has now risen to over 500 people , and will undoubtedly continue to rise as rescuers continue to search the hundreds of buildings that collapsed during the shaking . 
The tectonic forces ultimately responsible are quite straightforward to explain , but as is often the case , the picture becomes more complicated when we take a closer look - a fact that has consequences for the people caught up in this disaster . 
The big tectonic picture The most well - known seismic hazard in Turkey is probably the North Anatolian Fault , a major strike - slip fault which runs along the south of the Black Sea and underneath Istanbul , and has a long history of damaging earthquakes . 
The East Anatolian Fault , another strike slip fault that runs southwest from eastern Turkey to the Mediterranean , is another well - known source of large earthquakes . 
But Sunday 's earthquake occurred some way to the east of these structures , in a high region known as the East Anatolian Plateau that has also seen its fair share of large earthquakes in the past . 
The focal mechanism shows that the latest rupture was due to movement on a thrust fault , a response to the crust around it being compressed in a north - south direction . 
As the figure to the left illustrates , this region is on the boundary between two regions with very different tectonics . ","Sunday|4;1|0;4|TIME|None

2011 Van earthquakes,10/23/2011,10/24/2011,Turkey earthquake: Why the country is such a hot spot for seismic activity,"As rescuers search through rubble hunting for survivors following Sunday 's magnitude 7.2 earthquake in eastern Turkey , scientists describe a country whose landscape continues to be sculpted and herded by ever-shifting plates of Earth 's crust . 
The quake 's epicenter was situated some 10 miles east of Lake Van , a salt lake that covers 1,450 square miles . 
Seismologists estimate that the crust ruptured some 12 miles below the surface . 
Authorities say the city of Ercis may have been the hardest hit . 
Located about nine miles east of the epicenter , the city of some 75,000 people saw 80 multiple - story buildings collapse , according to press reports . 
The city of Van , on the eastern shore of the lake , also saw many homes and buildings crumble .

The 7.2 - magnitude tremor devastated parts of Van province in the east of the country , collapsing hundreds of buildings into piles of twisted steel and chunks of concrete . In the immediate aftermath of the quake desperate survivors dug into the rubble with their bare hands , trying to rescue the trapped and injured . The worst hit area was Ercis , a town of 75,000 close to the Iranian border in one of Turkey 's most earthquake - prone zones , where more than 100 buildings have collapsed .

2011 Christchurch earthquake,2/22/2011,,Christchurch quake: Fears toll will rise sharply as night falls,"Did you feel the quake ? 
Tell us your story , send us your photos and video . 
At least 100 people remain trapped in the ruins of Christchurch tonight following a devastating earthquake which claimed at least 65 lives . Construction workers and search and rescue specialists are toiling under floodlights on a cold and wet night to dig out survivors and the dead from buildings flattened by the earthquake that ripped the city apart today . Prime Minister 
Key announced tonight that "" at least 65 people have lost their lives "" and noted the rescuers were still scrabbling through the ruins of collapsed buildings looking for injured and trapped survivors - and bodies . Christchurch 
Mayor Bob Parker tonight said more than 100 people were trapped in about six sites - but it was possible more were trapped in individual houses . TV3 has had unconfirmed reports that the death toll could reach between 200 and 300 . The Government is holding a press conference at 5.30 am this morning where more details will be revealed . 
This is likely to include an updated death toll . Police have launched a hotline , 0800 779997 , that people can call to report missing people . The death toll is already the second highest in a New Zealand earthquake - outranked only by the 256 people who died in the violent 7.9 1931 Hawke 's Bay quake , whose 70th anniversary was marked earlier this month . Police have reported "" multiple fatalities "" at several locations in the downtown area , including where two buses were crushed by falling buildings . Today 's shake , measured at magnitude 6.3 , followed the massive 7.1 tremor last September 4 . 
That one struck in the early hours of the morning and no one was killed . Today 's earthquake jolted the city at 12.51 pm , the worst possible time with the central city packed with lunch - hour shoppers , office workers and many school children . Victims were crushed to death as buildings collapsed , many of them weakened in last year 's event . The quake was not as powerful as the September 4 shake but was much shallower , leading to greater damage . Scientists put the epicentre at 10 km southeast of the city - apparently in the middle of the harbour at Lyttelton , the city 's coastal port - at a depth of only 5 km . About 30 people were thought to be trapped in the Pyne Gould Guinness building , its several floors pancaked on each other and tilted at a crazy angle . In the ruined CTV television building a number of Japanese students , newly arrived in Japan , were believed to be in the rubble . One injured man rescued from the building was quoted as saying he could hear other people talking . The famous cathedral in the city 's downtown square which stood undamaged last September lost its spire today and suffered heavy damage . Reports that people were in the spire when it tumbled into the church itself and the square outside could not be verified immediately . Police superintendent Dave Cliff said one police staff member was unaccounted for . "" We are doing everything possible to free people who are trapped , "" he aid . Mr Key flew to Christchurch this afternoon and after a quick tour of the city described it as "" utterly wrecked "" , adding "" this is an absolute tragedy for Christchurch "" . "" We may well be witnessing New Zealand 's darkest day , "" he said . Graphic photographs on television showed blood - splattered survivors scrambling from downed buildings or crawling from under shattered shop verandahs that had fallen on to city footpaths . Crushed cars lined parking spaces , masonry scattered across roads . Mr Parker , lauded for his behaviour and slick civic control in the wake of last year 's quake , said the damage today was much more severe . "" The city centre is like a war zone and damage is immense . ","At least 100 people|0 1 2 3|2|NUM|None

2011 Christchurch earthquake,2/22/2011,,Christchurch earthquake: parts of city to be abandoned,"The magnitude 6.3 quake that hit on February 22 shattered homes , heritage buildings and office blocks , and caused 166 confirmed deaths . 
Officials expect the toll to rise to more than 200 as rescuers continue to search for bodies in the rubble . 
John Key , the New Zealand prime minister , said some 10,000 houses will have to be demolished in the city , including 3,300 that were damaged by an earlier magnitude 7.1 quake on Sept. 4 that caused far less damage . 
Several hundred commercial buildings in the downtown area also will have to be bulldozed , he said . "" Potentially there are some ... areas of Christchurch which will need to be abandoned and we will have to provide other alternatives for people to live in because the land has been so badly damaged , we ca n't fix it – certainly not in a reasonable time frame , "" he said . 
Earthquakes can cause sections of earth to liquefy and push up to the surface as watery silt , a process called liquefaction . 
In Christchurch , 260,000 tons of silt have already been scraped away . "" There are some parts of Christchurch that ca n't be rebuilt on "" due to damage from liquefaction , Mr Key said .

The number of residents without power might start to fluctuate on a daily basis , and people should be prepared for further power cuts , Orion said . The company continued to find new faults and the network in the eastern suburbs remained extremely fragile . 
Meanwhile , water has been restored to 84 percent of households and the council hopes that figure will rise to 98 percent by Friday . However , it would take at least two weeks before the water supply was safe and that included water sourced from taps , tankers , private wells or aquifers , Medical Officer of Health Ramon Pink said . People still needed to be careful using water for drinking , brushing teeth or preparing food , Dr Pink said . The DHB was helping the council undertake an extensive water testing programme . People should also continue to conserve water , he said . ","Christchurch|5|0|LOC|loc

Passengers of two explorer boats were hit with waves of up to 3.5 metres as the ice crashed into Terminal Lake under the Tasman Glacier at the mountain . Aoraki Mount Cook Alpine Village tourism manager Denis Callesen said huge icebergs formed in the lake , which were then rocked by massive waves for 30 minutes . The danger to passengers could have been worse if not for safety proceedures put in place when it was suspected the area was becoming unstable , he said . "" We have procedures to deal with this type of event and for some time have stayed 800 metres away from the Terminal Face as we suspected it was becoming unstable , "" he said . It was the third biggest amount of ice to fall in the history of the Terminal Lake , which is now over six kilometres long and two kilomtres wide in places , said Mr Callesen .

Victims continued to send text messages , tap rubble and shout for help as emergency services tried to find them in streets littered with bodies . One woman was found alive after sheltering beneath her desk in the ruined Pyne Gould building , but fears were growing for mother Ann Voss who had given numerous media interviews from beneath her desk underneath the same pile of ruins .

Former Labour foreign office minister Denis MacShane expressed horror that British diplomacy was now carried out in such a manner . 
But Downing Street said Mr Cameron is close friends with New Zealand premier John Key – and the only reason he texted rather than telephoned was because he knew Mr Key would be busy dealing with the aftermath of the tremor . No 10 released the text of a written letter he later sent to Mr Key – to show that he did not purely converse with world leaders by text and said Mr Cameron had phoned his counterpart last night . Mr Cameron , who is touring the Middle East , sent the initial message as soon as he learned of New Zealand ’s worst natural disaster in almost a century .

2011 Christchurch earthquake,2/22/2011,,Christchurch earthquake may affect Rugby World Cup,"Among the hundreds of buildings damaged by the quake , which claimed at least 65 lives , was the city ’s AMI Stadium , where England are scheduled to open their Rugby World Cup campaign against Argentina on Sept 10 . The stadium , which had been playing host to a business and community forum when the quake struck , suffered superficial damage in the first earthquake last September . 
The extent of any new damage was not immediately clear , although some reports suggested that cracks had been spotted in the structure . The Crowne Plaza , the five - star hotel allocated to Martin Johnson ’s squad was also damaged by the quake , which measured 6.3 on the Richter Scale . 
The hotel had been hosting a health conference when the earthquake struck . 
Dr David Malouf , president of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand , who was one of the delegates , has said it felt like a wrecking ball was being smashed into the side of the building as the ground shook for almost a minute . “ The whole building started to shake , violently shaking to the point where , if you were trying to stand up , you would fall over , ” said Dr Malouf , who said the quake had left cracks in buildings and fissures in the roads . 
The hotel has been evacuated to allow engineers to assess the damage . 
Christchurch is due to stage seven matches , including England ’s second pool match against Georgia on Sept 18 and Scotland 's match against Argentina on Sept 25 . Two of the four quarter - final matches , on Oct 8 and 9 , are also scheduled to be played in the city , the latter which will feature the winner of the pool containing England and Scotland . 
A Rugby World Cup fan zone has been planned for the city ’s Cathedral Square . ","hundreds|2|0|NUM|None
